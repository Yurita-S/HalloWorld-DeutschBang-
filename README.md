# HalloWorld (DeutschBang!)

## ðŸŽ® Game Description

HalloWorld (DeutschBang!) is a mini language-learning game designed to make German feel less like schoolwork and more like a vibe.

The game is divided into two modes:

- Flashcard Mode: You'll be shown English phrases one by one. Press Enter to reveal the German translation. It's like flipping through fun, random, and sometimes romantic language cards.
  
- Quiz Mode: Ready for a challenge? The game gives you 3 multiple-choice questions based on the phrases. One correct answer, three sneaky distractors. Pick wisely.

What makes it special?

- The phrases range from *useful* ("Where is the toilet?"), to *sweet* ("My heart beats for you"), to *just plain dumb* ("I am a potato.")
- There's no grammar, no textbooks, and definitely no boring drills.
- It's built entirely with Python â€“ no fancy libraries â€“ just pure logic, lists, and love ðŸ’–

You can choose between four categories: 'greetings', 'love', 'daily', and 'fun', each with their own personality and expression.

At the end of the day, maybe you won't pass a German exam with thisâ€¦  
But you might make someone laugh. Or fall in love. In German.
